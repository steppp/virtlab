in vuos:
	in vunet/vunet_ioctl.c:34:10: error: 'SIOCGSTAMP' undeclared
	starting from linux kernel v5.2-rc1 'SIOCGSTAMP' has been renamed to 'SIOCGSTAMP_OLD'
	FIX: to access it again 'linux/sockios.h' needs to be included

in purelibc:
	in dir.c:106:5: error: conflicting types for 'getdents64'
	starting from glibc v2.31 getdents64 is defined as
		ssize_t __getdents64 (int fd, void *buf, size_t nbytes)
	FIX: replace the function's signature in dir.c
	WARNING: almost certainly this breaks compatibility with other OSes

	in syscall.c:902:5: error: conflicting types for 'gettimeofday'
	in the current environment (kernel v5.5.7-arch1-1) 'gettimeofday' has a different signature, probably
		because of glibc as previously
	FIX: replace the function's signature in syscalls.c
	WARNING: almost certainly this breaks compatibility with other OSes
